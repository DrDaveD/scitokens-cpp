This package is built by cvmfs-contrib on the OpenSUSE Build System
  https://build.opensuse.org/project/show/home:cvmfs:contrib
OBS requires a little help from the package in order to build on 
Debian.  Each time there's a new release, run obsupdate.sh in this
directory and commit the newly updated scitokens-cpp.dsc.
